## assignment 1
This week we were asked to create a simple calculator. Below is my thought process:

Take in an input that is a number , store it as firstNumber 
If ____ is a number, then ask for a second number, else ask for a different first number
Take in an input that is another number , store it as secondNumber 
If ____ is a number, then ask for the operation, else ask for a different secondNumber
Ask the user for an operation "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "/" for division, and "*" for multiplication 
If _____ is not one of the 4 operations, then complete the following function 
thirdNumber = 0
firstNumber operation secondNumber = thirdNumber
print thirdNumber 
else ask for a different operation 

Another? Y for Yes N for No 
If "Y" , then start the process over , else terminate the program
